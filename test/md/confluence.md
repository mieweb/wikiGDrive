# Confluence to Google Docs Conversion Notes

## Goal

Convert Confluence Documents in to Google Documents for the purpose of using WikiGDrive to publish them.



## Delivery

A new github repo with a node.js script specific to this conversion.

## High level Process

* Scan all of the documents in a Confluence Space

* Make google documents in a shared drive (two passes will be required so links between documents can be known as content is added).
    * Parent/Child relationship must be intact.

* Import Confluence "Attachments" to Google Drive so they can be referenced.

* For each document

    * Import content from Confluence Page into Google Documents

    * Heading should be headings

    * Paragraphs should be paragraphs

    * Images (which are attachments in Confluence) should be embedded in google docs

    * Macros can be wrapped in {{% curlies %}} and dumped as text

        * <strong><em>Example Block Macro:</em></strong>   {{% macroname propertyname='value' propertyname='value' %}} macro body, if exists {{% /macroname %}}

        * <strong>Example Inline Macro:</strong> {{% macroname propertyname='value' propertyname='value' /%}}

    * Tables should be kept tables

    * Embedded Video should be converted to an image with a hyperlink

    * Formatting is not required to be converted.
