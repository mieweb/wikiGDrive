* Import Confluence "Attachments" to Google Drive so they can be referenced.

* For each document

    * Import content from Confluence Page into Google Documents

    * Heading should be headings

    * Paragraphs should be paragraphs

    * Images (which are attachments in Confluence) should be embedded in google docs

    * Macros can be wrapped in {{% curlies %}} and dumped as text

        * <strong><em>Example Block Macro:</em></strong>   {{% macroname propertyname='value' propertyname='value' %}} macro body, if exists {{% /macroname %}}

        * <strong>Example Inline Macro:</strong> {{% macroname propertyname='value' propertyname='value' /%}}
