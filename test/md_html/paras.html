<h3>Why not make a website front end to a Google shared drive?</h3>
<p>Our goals are to be able to take versions of the content and commit them along with a version of the code at a point in time. By just making a website, it would allow for real-time viewing of the content but no way to go to a specific version of the documentation at a given time.</p><br />
<p>A website front end is a goal for real-time testing of the viewing experience, but initially, we want to make markdown that can be committed.</p><br />
