{{% warning title="Remember" %}}
Action items that are configured with a Trigger Date of **Prior Action (Completed)** will require an order item be specified, in order for there to be an available record in the chart history with a Last Completed Date. This is necessary, so that any additional triggered actions dependent upon the Last Completed Date of the specified order item will be triggered.

{{% note %}}
Health Questionnaires (if being done electronically and via portal) would be an Encounter event type and the specific electronic encounter order item would need selected (the order item that points to the electronic health questionnaire layout). For every questionnaire that users want documented electronically, via an encounter, two (2) order items and panel actions are needed; that's one (1) for the Health Questionnaire electronic encounter and the other (1) for the Due List item, in order to mark Complete.
