## Editing Scanned Batches

Once documents have been scanned into the WebScan module, users may make any necessary edits to the batch, before uploading the scanned documents into the respective charts.

Indexing can be done immediately following scanning, or saved for a later time.

**Move Left** or **Move Right**: Users can use the Move Left or Move Right button to rearrange the pages of a batch. After using the Prev and Next buttons to navigate through the pages, users can then use the Move Left button to place the current page being displayed ahead (i.e., to the left) of the next page. Clicking the Move Right button will place the current page after (i.e., to the right) one page.

**Crop**: Users may Crop a document prior to indexing it to a chart. First, navigate to the page needing cropped, using the Prev or Next button, accordingly. To utilize the Crop feature, simply hover the mouse over the scanned image and place the cross cursor (+) at the starting point of the intended crop. Left-click and hold the mouse button, dragging the cursor over the scanned image, highlighting (in black) the area intended to be cropped and kept. Release the mouse. If the highlighted field needs redone, simply left-click the mouse again, and resize the crop field. When ready, click the **Crop** button. The area highlighted in black will be saved. After clicking the Crop button, the image will refresh, showing the cropped document in the upper-left corner. The cropped image will be stored in the chart, once uploaded. If more of the document requires cropping, simply continue by repeating the steps, above.
